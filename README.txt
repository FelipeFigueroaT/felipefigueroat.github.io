Hi, I'm Felipe!

I'm currently an undergraduate student of Physics at Universidad de Valpara√≠so, in Chile. I am working in two topics: First, I'm working on the study of Stellar Winds of Massive Stars (specially in O and B stars), and I am also working on the study of quiescence state of dwarf novae.
